# dqlite-vip

**Dqlite-vip** is a small, self-contained program designed to create a highly
available cluster of Linux machines within a local network, without imposing
specific requirements on the software running on the nodes.

The programâ€™s primary function is to assign a configurable virtual IP address to
one of the machines in the cluster (i.e., the elected leader) and to
automatically transfer the virtual IP to another machine if/when the current
leader fails.

As its name suggests, dqlite-vip is built on [Dqlite](https://dqlite.io/), an
embeddable, and highly available data store powered by the Raft consensus
algorithm.

## Architecture

A typical dqlite-vip cluster consists of 3, 5, or 7 nodes. Because dqlite-vip is
built on Dqlite, which implements the Raft consensus algorithm, all best
practices and considerations for Raft also apply to dqlite-vip.

To point out a few of the most important ones:

1. For the cluster to remain operational, the majority of its nodes must be
   available. The majority is defined as `(n/2) + 1`, where `n` is the number of
   nodes in the cluster.
2. Run an odd number of nodes in the cluster. The reason is that a cluster with
   `2n` nodes can tolerate the exact same number of failures as a cluster with
   `2n-1` nodes.
3. Clusters with more than 7 nodes are not recommended due to the additional
   overhead of determining cluster membership and quorum

Once the cluster is up and running, the leader node will hold the virtual IP and
will be responsible for broadcasting
[Gratuitous ARP](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Gratuitous_ARP) packets to update
the ARP tables of the other machines in the network:

**dqlite-vip** has 4 main components:

- **CLI**: A command-line interface to start the program and configure the
  static parameters (e.g., data directory, network interface, etc.).
- **Cluster**: dqlite-vip manages a cluster of Dqlite nodes. The node that is
  elected as the leader will hold the virtual IP address.
- **API**: A REST API that can be used to monitor the status of the cluster and
  configure the virtual IP.
- **VIP**: The VIP component is responsible for assigning the configured virtual
  IP address to a network interface on the leader node and for broadcasting
  Gratuitous ARP packets to update other machines' ARP table.

## Requirements

1. An amd64 or arm64 Linux machine running a kernel with support for
   [native async I/O](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/io_setup.2.html).
2. A stable and low-latency network connection between the nodes in the cluster.
3. `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities are required to run the
   program.

## Quick Start

To start a dqlite-vip cluster, you need to run the program on each node in the
cluster.

The quickest way to get **dqlite-vip** running is to download a pre-built
release binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/fardjad/dqlite-vip/releases) on GitHub. The
releases are available for _amd64_ and _arm64_ architectures.

```bash
DQLITE_VIP_BINARY=/path/to/dqlite-vip

sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep $DQLITE_VIP_BINARY
sudo install -Dm755 $DQLITE_VIP_BINARY /usr/local/bin/dqlite-vip
```

You can then start the program on the first machine with the following command:

```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data-dir # replace with the path to the data directory (e.g., `/opt/dqlite-vip/data`)
NODE_IP="1.2.3.4" # replace with the node's IP address
IFACE="eth0" # replace with the network interface to use for the VIP

dqlite-vip start \
  --data-dir "${DATA_DIR}" \
  --bind-cluster "${NODE_IP}:8800" \
  --bind-http "127.0.0.1:9900" \
  --iface "${IFACE}"
```

On the other machines, you can start the program with the same command, but you
need to provide the address of the first machine (or another machine that's
already part of the cluster) with the `--join` flag:

```bash
JOIN_IP="1.2.3.4" # replace with the IP address of another node in the cluster

dqlite-vip start \
  --data-dir "${DATA_DIR}" \
  --bind-cluster "${NODE_IP}:8800" \
  --bind-http "127.0.0.1:9900" \
  --iface "${IFACE}" \
  --join "${JOIN_IP}:8800"
```

> [!NOTE]
> After the cluster gets formed, the join option will be ignored on subsequent
> runs.

Once all nodes are up and running, you can use the REST API to monitor the state
of the cluster and configure the virtual IP.

Get the status of the cluster (run on any node):

```bash
curl http://localhost:9900/status | jq
```

Configure the virtual IP (run on any node):

```bash
VIP="1.2.3.5" # replace with the virtual IP address
SUBNET_PREFIX_LENGTH="24" # replace with the subnet prefix length

curl -XPUT -d '{"vip":"'${VIP}/${SUBNET_PREFIX_LENGTH}'"}' http://localhost:9900/vip
```

After setting the virtual IP, the leader node will set the IP address on the
configured network interface and will start broadcasting Gratuitous ARP packets.

You can then ping the virtual IP from any machine in the network:

```bash
ping -c 1 ${VIP}
```
